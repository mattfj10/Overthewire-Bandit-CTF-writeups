# Overthewire-CTF-writeups
This repository will be a series of markdown writeups for the overthewire 
bandit series of CTFs. I've wanted to get hands on experience with CTFs
for awhile now and I figured this was a good opportunity, and the writeups
would be something for me to put up on my mostly empty github.
I hope that this can be used as a resource to help other people as well
as they follow me through my CTF journey. If you see any errors in spelling
or things that could be written/worded/formatted better please make a pull
request and I'll have a look at it. I'm always eager for advice
to improve my writing. Thanks.
